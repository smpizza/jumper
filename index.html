    <br><h4>Dear Graduate Coordinator:</h4>
    <p id="q1">
         I am applying for the online Master of Computer and Information Technology (MCIT) program. I want to make a career switch to programming, but I don’t have a computer science background. I’m currently a temporary contractor at Intel’s semiconductor factory and I want to find a way into the software industry. Prior to Intel, I worked a few other contract jobs while finishing my bachelor’s degree in general science at Portland State University. I didn’t think about computer science at the time because I was really interested in environmental and social sciences. However, due to economic and political circumstances the national park services is in a state of decline despite record visitation numbers. I have an engineering background as a drafter and designer in construction for 12 years. I initially pursued coding boot camps, but the more interesting jobs in IOT and Software Automation require more than software skills. Concepts in big data analytics, databases, support infrastructures, frameworks, and C programming are also necessary. The MCIT curriculum is attractive to me because it provides the computation theory and practices I need.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will benefit from this program in several ways. First, I won’t have to spend another 4 years (or money) on another undergraduate degree. Second, the curriculum provides the necessary foundation in computational theory to become a computer scientist; compared to someone who can only write code. Third, I have always enjoyed the flexibility and personalities from online learning platforms. Fourth, the cost is affordable and one-third the price of most MBA’s. Last, if accepted the networking possibilities would not only benefit me, but also the MCIT program as well, because I would help extend the MCIT network further among companies in the west coast areas. I will succeed in the program by using such tools as: the SMART goal formula to define clear objectives; a time tracking app, clockify, to help with time management; a task list app, todoist, that syncs with Google calendar; websites (developer.mozilla.org, stackoverflow.com, codeschool.com) to troubleshoot or find additional information; my cohorts; my professors and ta’s; and most importantly keeping my professors aware of any problems or potential issues. I expect many challenges from this program, but I have several years of taking online classes through D2L, Blackboard, Canvas, edX, DuoLingo, Linkedin In Learning and Memrise. I’m also very familiar with the issues of collaborating with different people in different time zones and trying to hit group deadlines.
     </p>
    <p>
      I will contribute to the MCIT community by extending is network, and providing feedback regarding current industry trends; as well suggestions to improve the online MCIT program. I will also do my best to represent the university as a whole in different activities, whether online in github forums or events such as hackathons. These contributions will also further my career goals in the process, by refining my ideas about computing trends and broadening my experiences in both software and hardware capabilities. Someday I will be a software engineer, or tester, in manufacturing and the MCIT program has a good track record with alumni commenting on their positive experiences. I hope to be one of those alumni and telling the tech industry that MCIT is a great program and help me achieved my goals.
